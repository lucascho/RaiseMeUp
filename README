RaiseMe  - version 1.0 beta

RaiseMe  is a cross-platform builder game that allows players to place blocks onto a grid to build stairs that helps a guy escape from the rising water. Players have to use certain strategy to build higher buildings at a reasonable pace to avoid the guy from drowning. Rewards will be shown above the grids including blocks. Blocks are limited to the players such that players have to earn blocks to keep building higher.  It can be played by multiple users as well. (optional for this hack due to time constraint.)
